      "I am a programmer who is of old age and works in Beijing.",
      "Curiosity is seriously excessive, and there are no boundaries to learning; having worked with several Microsoft ecosystem products such as .net, WinForm, WPF, Silverlight, etc. for several years, I am familiar with the entire development process and have worked as a technical manager, front-end leader, and architect.",
      "Leading the team to develop three low-code platforms from scratch, I have some insights in the low-code field. To summarize it in one sentence: it may or may not be necessary in terms of cost, but be careful not to undermine your brand reputation while promoting it.",
      "As a front-end developer, I have played around with various technologies such as Node.js, Deno, Uniapp, Electron (previously known as Node-Webkit), Go, and Flutter. Recently, I have been fascinated by the Rust, WebAssembly, and Tauri ecosystem, and I am deeply attracted to Rust's coding conventions. I hope to pursue Rust development in the future."
